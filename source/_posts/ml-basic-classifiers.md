## 1 Task description
- Based on the MNIST dataset, design and implement a proper convolutional neural network.
- Based on the MNIST dataset, design and implement classifiers including: least squares with regularization, Fisher discriminant analysis (with kernels), Perceptron (with kernels), logistic regression, SVM (with kernels), MLP-NN with two different error functions.
- (optional)Based on CNN classifiers, please implement an object detection task (including face recognition).
- Design and implement a proper recurrent neural network based on LSTM or/and GRU for Sentiment Analysis. Data is available at http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lstm.html
